Follow these instructions to start a cluster on EC2 running SCM Express.
SCM Express allows you to install a Hadoop cluster.

This method starts a cluster with
 * one node running the SCM Admin Console,
 * one node for running CDH client programs (e.g. to launch MapReduce jobs), and
 * a user-selectable number of nodes for the Hadoop cluster

Run the following commands from you local machine

# Set AWS credentials (you need an account, obviously)
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=...
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=...

# Install Whirr
curl -O http://www.apache.org/dist/incubator/whirr/whirr-0.5.0-incubating/whirr-0.5.0-incubating.tar.gz
tar zxf whirr-0.5.0-incubating.tar.gz
export PATH=$PATH:$(pwd)/whirr-0.5.0-incubating/bin
# Generate an SSH keypair for Whirr
ssh-keygen -t rsa -P '' -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa_whirr

# Launch a cluster consisting of a 'head' SCM server node (to manage the SCM installation) and a number of nodes that the cluster itself runs on.
# Change the number in the command line below if you want a different sized cluster. (TODO)
whirr launch-cluster --config scm-ec2.properties \
  --private-key-file ~/.ssh/id_rsa_whirr

The next step is to run the SCM Admin Console to install and configure Hadoop,
using the instructions at
https://ccp.cloudera.com/display/CDHDOC/Installing+CDH3+with+Service+and+Configuration+Manager+Express+Edition

The output of the launch cluster command includes settings for the cluster hosts
and the authentication method to be used while running the SCM Admin Console.

Once the Hadoop cluster is up and running you can use it via Hue (the URL
is printed by the launch cluster command), or from the CDH client machine. In
the latter case, copy the configuration files from the SCM Admin Console to the
CDH client machine using the SCM instructions.

Finally, when you want to shutdown the cluster, run the following command. Note
that all data on the cluster will be lost.

whirr destroy-cluster --config scm-ec2.properties
