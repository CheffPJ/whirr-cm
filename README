Follow these instructions to start a cluster on EC2 running SCM Express.
SCM Express allows you to install a Hadoop cluster.

Run the following commands from you local machine

# Set AWS credentials (you need an account, obviously)
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=...
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=...

# Install Whirr
curl -O http://www.apache.org/dist/incubator/whirr/whirr-0.5.0-incubating/whirr-0.5.0-incubating.tar.gz
tar zxf whirr-0.5.0-incubating.tar.gz
export PATH=$PATH:$(pwd)/whirr-0.5.0-incubating/bin
# Generate an SSH keypair for Whirr
ssh-keygen -t rsa -P '' -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa_whirr

# Launch a cluster consisting of a 'head' SCM server node (to manage the SCM installation) and a number of nodes that the cluster itself runs on.
# Change the number in the command line below if you want a different sized cluster. (TODO)
whirr launch-cluster --config scm-ec2.properties \
  --private-key-file ~/.ssh/id_rsa_whirr

The next step is to run the SCM Admin Console to install and configure Hadoop.
The instructions for this can be found at https://ccp.cloudera.com/display/CDHDOC/Installing+CDH3+with+Service+and+Configuration+Manager+Express+Edition

Get started by connecting to the SCM server URL printed by the launch command.

In the step where you are asked for cluster hosts, paste in the output of running
grep scmnode ~/.whirr/scmcluster/instances | awk '{print $4}'

When prompted for "Provide SSH login credentials" choose "another user" and
enter your username for the machine you used for launching the cluster.

For "Authentication Method", choose "All hosts accept same public key" and enter
your public and private keys generated earlier (browse to
~/.ssh/id_rsa_whirr.pub and ~/.ssh/id_rsa_whirr). Leave the passphrase blank.

Complete the steps in the SCM installation guide.

When you want to shutdown the cluster, run the following command:

whirr destroy-cluster --config scm-ec2.properties
